I understand you want to build a complete multi-tenant Document Management      
System. This is a large project, and I'll need to build it systematically.      

Before I start, I need to know which files you'd like me to add to the chat so I
can edit them. Based on your build instructions, the most critical files that   
will need to be created/edited first are:                                       

Backend (Phase 1):                                                              

 • /backend/package.json                                                        
 • /backend/.env                                                                
 • /backend/src/config/database.js                                              
 • /backend/src/app.js                                                          

Frontend (Phase 2):                                                             

 • /frontend/package.json                                                       
 • /frontend/vite.config.js                                                     
 • /frontend/tailwind.config.js                                                 
 • /frontend/src/main.jsx                                                       

These are the foundational files that need to be created first before building  
out the rest of the application.                                                

Which files would you like me to add to the chat so I can start building?
